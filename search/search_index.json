Identity services in AWS include Amazon Cognito for Application Identity and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for AWS Management Console, Command Line Interface (CLI) access and Infrastructure Identity. Infrastructure identity includes access to operating systems, relational databases and containers. This workshop focuses on infrastructure identity where you can utilize IAM Users, Roles and Policies to grant access to infrastructure such as EC2, RDS and ECS. This workshop is designed to help you get familiar with AWS Security services and learn how to use them to securely administer systems in your environment. You'll be working with services such as AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, Amazon EC2 Instance Connect, and AWS Identity and Access Management. You will learn how to use these services to securely connect and administer your Amazon EC2 Instances as well as systems on-premises, you will setup tagged based access, and configure logging which will enable auditing of administrative activities and improve the security posture of your environment. Level : Intermediate Duration : 2 hours CSF Functions : Protect and Detect CAF Components : Preventative, Detective Prerequisites : AWS Account, Admin IAM User Scenario Your company is new to the cloud and has deployed their first set of development and productions systems in AWS, additionally you still have hosts to manage in your data center. You are a systems administrator and have been tasked with setting up secure administrative access to your systems in AWS and on-premises. As part of that configuration you are also responsible for confirming that you can audit administrative activities. Security has found that ssh keys are not properly secured and has asked for a better solution that includes EC2 Instances in AWS and on-premises systems. Your security team has asked if there is way to centrally manage administrative access to systems and have full audit capabilities. Architecture In the first module we launch 4 instances in the us-east-1 region, 2 instances will be your EC2 instances, the other 2 instances will be mock on-premises systems. Additionally, we will be build a Cloud9 IDE environment and use this as our workspace for the workshop. AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes pre-packaged with essential tools for popular programming languages and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) pre-installed so you don\u2019t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

Instead of hoping our system security doesn't change, let's ensure all changes introduced into production are treated like a code release which go through our standard deployment pipeline, this pipeline includes appropriate security and configuration checks as well as code reviews. Given this change to our process we will restrict all access into production systems. This approach to administrative access is called Immutable Infrastructure , which includes managing services and software deployments on IT resources wherein components are replaced rather than changed. An application or service is effectively redeployed each time changes are required. Given this is a new access pattern for our team, we will continue to allow access to our development systems. Using Amazon Systems Manager Session Manager and AWS IAM with tag based permissions we will implement this exact scenario and review the audit logs. In this Module we will create IAM roles with permissions to enable Session Manager access. Additionally, we are going to deploy 4 systems: AWS EC2 Instance tagged with development AWS EC2 Instance tagged with production Mock on-premises system tagged with development Mock on-premises system tagged with production Please note our mock on-premises systems will be EC2 instances, however we will treat them like on-premises systems by not assigning an Instance Profile. Terminology A managed instance is any machine configured for AWS Systems Manager. You can configure Amazon EC2 instances or on-premisess machines in a hybrid environment as a managed instance . Systems Manager supports various distributions of Linux, including Raspberry Pi devices, and Microsoft Windows Server. In the AWS Management Console, any machine prefixed with \"mi-\" is an on-premisess server or virtual machine (VM) managed instance . AWS Systems Manager offers a standard-instances tier and an advanced-instances tier for servers and VMs in your hybrid environment. Advanced instances also enable you to connect to your hybrid machines by using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Session Manager provides interactive shell access to your instances. While this lab focuses on Session Manager which is a capability of AWS Systems Manager there are several other capabilities of AWS Systems Manager that you can take advantage of, more information about System Manager Capabilities Tasks Create IAM roles and permissions to enable Session Manager Setup AWS Systems Manager to manage systems on-premises Create instances and install the SSM Agent Configure Systems Manager and enable management of on-premises systems Create IAM users and policy restrictions based on tags Configure logging Confirm appropriate access and review logs Task 1: Create IAM roles and permissions to enable Session Manager for Amazon EC2 Instances 1.Return to the AWS Cloud9 console and use the tab that you opened in Module 1. 2.Create an instance profile: aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name SSMLabProfile 3.Create the json trust policy doc to attach to the IAM role. Create a new file with the following contents, save the file name: lab-role-trust-policy.json : { Version : 2012-10-17 , Statement : { Effect : Allow , Principal : { Service : ec2.amazonaws.com }, Action : sts:AssumeRole } } 4.Create an IAM role using the trust policy above: aws iam create-role --role-name SSMLabRole --assume-role-policy-document file://lab-role-trust-policy.json 5.Add the role to the instance profile: aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --role-name SSMLabRole --instance-profile-name SSMLabProfile 6.Attach the existing EC2RoleSSMAccess to the newly created instance-profile: aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM --role-name SSMLabRole 7.Create the json trust policy doc to attach to the IAM role. Create a new file with the following contents, save the file name: ssmservice-trust-policy.json { Version : 2012-10-17 , Statement : { Effect : Allow , Principal : { Service : ssm.amazonaws.com }, Action : sts:AssumeRole } } 8.Create a new role named SSMServiceRole and attach the trust policy you created in the previous step: aws iam create-role --role-name SSMServiceRole --assume-role-policy-document file://ssmservice-trust-policy.json 9.As a starting point, we will use AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore to grant permission for Systems Manager to interact with your instances. AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore, enables an instance to use AWS Systems Manager service core functionality. Depending on your operations plan, you might need permissions represented in one or more of the other three policies. To view this policy in the console go to services, IAM, Access Management, Policies and search for the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy, click on the policy, view the permissions by clicking on the permissions tab. Now attach this policy to the role using attach-role-policy command. aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name SSMServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore 10.Let's make sure we allow our on-premises systems to write to CloudWatchLogs so that we can use the same Audit and Logging tools to review administrative access. We'll use the same Attach-role-policy to attach a policy that enables the SSMServiceRole to write to CloudWatchLogs. aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name SSMServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy 11.Let's confirm all the correct policies are attached to our role. Run the following command. aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name SSMServiceRole The result should return the following: { AttachedPolicies : [ { PolicyName : CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy }, { PolicyName : AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore } ] } 12.Let's also confirm the trust policy is correct. We want to confirm that for the Principal in the AssumeRolePolicyDocument is \"Service\":\"ssm.amazonaws.com\" , which allows the AWS Systems Manager Service the permissions granted in the policies we attached and listed in the previous steps. Run the following command: aws iam get-role --role-name SSMServiceRole The result should return the following: { Role : { AssumeRolePolicyDocument : { Version : 2012-10-17 , Statement : [ { Action : sts:AssumeRole , Effect : Allow , Principal : { Service : ssm.amazonaws.com } } ] }, MaxSessionDuration : 3600, RoleId : AROATXJRVGL4QLCVNGI77 , CreateDate : 2020-03-03T14:59:37Z , RoleName : SSMServiceRole , Path : / , RoleLastUsed : {}, Arn : arn:aws:iam::256191574777:role/SSMServiceRole } } Task 2: Setup AWS Systems Manager to manage systems on-premises The activation process provides an Activation Code and ID which functions like an access key ID and secret key to provide secure access to the Systems Manager service from your managed instances . Attention If you've been using the Cloud9IDE in this lab please continue to run these commands from there. 1.In your Cloud9IDE, using the same tab, create a managed-instance activation for your Dev instance, copy the \"activation-code\" and \"activation-id\" and label it as DevOnPrem in your scratch pad, we will use it later. aws ssm create-activation --default-instance-name DevOnPrem --iam-role SSMServiceRole --registration-limit 10 --region us-east-1 2.Create a managed-instance activation for your Prod instance, copy the \"activation-code\" and \"activation-id\" and label it as ProdOnPrem in your scratch pad, we will use it later. aws ssm create-activation --default-instance-name ProdOnPrem --iam-role SSMServiceRole --registration-limit 10 --region us-east-1 Store the managed-instance Activation Code and Activation ID in a safe place. You specify this Code and ID when you install SSM Agent on systems on-premises. The code and ID combination functions like an Amazon EC2 access key ID and secret key to provide secure access to the Systems Manager service from your managed instances . If you lose the Code and ID, you must create a new activation. An activation expiration is a window of time when you can register on-premises machines with Systems Manager, default is 24 hours. An expired activation has no impact on your servers or virtual machines (VMs) that you registered with Systems Manager. This means that if an activation expires then you can\u2019t register more servers or VMs with Systems Manager by using that specific activation code. You simply need to create a new one. All of the servers and VMs that you registered will continue to be registered Systems Manager managed instances until you remove or disable SSM Agent on the server or VM and thereby unregister it. For more details: Task 3: Create instances and install the SSM Agent Please note that in order to create a mock on-premises system we need to create and use key-pair for initial access to install the Systems Manager agent. We do not need a key pair for the AWS EC2 instances because we are using Session Manager to gain direct access. Attention If you are using Cloud9, please perform the following on the Cloud9 instance. 1.Create a key pair for SSH access to the on-premises systems. Choose a key name that you can remember, and replace MyKeyPair with that name. aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query KeyMaterial --output text MyKeyPair.pem 2.Update the permissions on the private key file so that only you can read it. chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem 3.Copy the name of your key pair to your scratch pad. Info What is a Key Pair? Amazon EC2 uses public key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, and then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair. Public key cryptography enables you to securely access your instances using a private key instead of a password. When you launch an instance, you specify the key pair. You can specify an existing key pair or a new key pair that you create at launch. At boot time, the public key content is placed on the instance in an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. To log in to your instance, you must specify the private key when you connect to the instance. 4.Go back to the CloudFormation Stack, copy the following to your scratchpad: Find the stack that starts with \"aws-cloud9-\" click on Resources , copy the ID next to the InstanceSecurityGroup Find the stack named \"InfrastructureIdentity-Env-Setup\", click on Resources , copy the ID next to PublicSubnet1 to the same scratch pad Tip At this point, make sure you have captured 3 items on your scratch pad: SECGROUP - the security group ID of the InstanceSecurityGroup SUBNET - the subnet ID of PublicSubnet1 MYKEYPAIR - the name of the key pair you created. 5.Let's use a script to build our systems. Create a file called CreateSystems.sh. Copy the items from your scratch pad and replace them in the file you just created. #!/bin/bash ## update with your subnet SUBNET= subnet-xxxx ## update with your security group SECGROUP= sg-xxxx ## update with your own key MYKEYPAIR= MyKeyPairxxxx ##update with your region REGION= us-east-1 #---no need to modify below---- ## Create the Production Ec 2 Instance aws ec 2 run-instances --iam-instance-profile Name=SSMLabProfile --image-id ami -00 80e4 c 5 bc 078760 e --instance-type t 1 .micro --subnet-id ${SUBNET} --security-group-ids ${SECGROUP} --associate-public-ip-address --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags= [{ Key= Name , Value= ProdEC2Instance },{ Key= Environment , Value= Prod }] --region ${REGION} ## Create the Development Ec 2 Instance aws ec 2 run-instances --iam-instance-profile Name=SSMLabProfile --image-id ami -00 80e4 c 5 bc 078760 e --instance-type t 1 .micro --subnet-id ${SUBNET} --security-group-ids ${SECGROUP} --associate-public-ip-address --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags= [{ Key= Name , Value= DevEC2Instance },{ Key= Environment , Value= Dev }] --region ${REGION} ## Create the Production on-premises system aws ec 2 run-instances --image-id ami -00 80e4 c 5 bc 078760 e --instance-type t 1 .micro --subnet-id ${SUBNET} --security-group-ids ${SECGROUP} --associate-public-ip-address --key-name ${MYKEYPAIR} --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags= [{ Key= Name , Value= ProdOnPrem },{ Key= Environment , Value= Prod }] --region ${REGION} ## Create the Development on-premises system aws ec 2 run-instances --image-id ami -00 80e4 c 5 bc 078760 e --instance-type t 1 .micro --subnet-id ${SUBNET} --security-group-ids ${SECGROUP} --associate-public-ip-address --key-name ${MYKEYPAIR} --tag-specifications ResourceType=instance,Tags= [{ Key= Name , Value= DevOnPrem },{ Key= Environment , Value= Dev }] --region ${REGION} 6.Change the permissions on your scripts so that only you as the owner can execute it. chmod 0755 CreateSystems.sh 7.Execute the script. ./CreateSystems.sh 8.Let's confirm that we have 4 new systems running. Go to EC2 Console Click on Running Systems you will see a list of systems. Click on each of the new systems. Notice that ProdEC2Instance and DevEC2Instance do not have Key pair names associated as we built them without a key pair and will be using Session Manager to access them. We will use the key pair only for the OnPrem systems as we need to install the SSM Agent. ProdEC2Instance DevEC2Instance ProdOnPrem DevOnPrem 9.For each instance find the private IPv4 address and copy it to your scratchpad. To find the private IPv4 address from the Amazon EC2 console check the box next to the instance, a menu with details including the Private IPs will show on the bottom of the screen, copy the Private IP address associated to that instance to your scratchpad. Do this for all 4 new systems. Your scratchpad should be similar to the following: ProdEC2Instance 172.20.1.x DevEC2Instance 172.20.1.x ProdOnPrem 172.20.1.x DevOnPrem 172.20.1.x 10.Update the inbound rules for the Cloud9 Security Group to only allow SSH from the VPC Subnet 172.20.0.0/16. From the EC2 Console scroll down to NETWORK SECURITY , click on Security Groups , click the box next to the Security Group that starts with \"aws-cloud9-mod-\" , go to the inbound tab and click edit. Click Add Rule , Under Type select SSH , for the Source use 172.20.0.0/16 and add \"VPC\" in the description. The updated inbound rules for the Security Group should look like this: The public address ranges already in the Security Group are the public addresses for the Cloud9 Service for the us-east-1 region, for more information . 11.From your Cloud9 instance ssh to the DevOnPrem instance. You specify the path and file name of the private key (.pem), the user name for your AMI, and the private ip address for the instance. Note: Replace MyKeyPair.pem with the name of the key-pair you created, this should be in your scratch pad. And replace 172.20.x.x with the Private IP associated with the DevOnPrem instance. ssh -i MyKeyPair.pem ec2-user@172.20.x.x 12.Then run the following commands to install SSM. Note: Replace \"activation-code\" and \"activation-id\" for the DevOnPrem instance with the code and id on your scratch pad. sudo yum update -Y mkdir /tmp/ssm curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm sudo yum install -y /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm sudo stop amazon-ssm-agent sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code activation-code -id activation-id -region us-east-1 sudo start amazon-ssm-agent 13.From your Cloud9 instance use the ssh command to connect to ProdOnPrem instance. You specify the path and file name of the private key (.pem), the user name for your AMI, and the private ip address for the instance. Additionally, you will need the private IPv4 address for your instance using the Amazon EC2 console. From the Amazon EC2 console check the box next to the ProdOnPrem instance, a menu with details including the Private IPs will show on the bottom of the screen, copy the Private IP address associated to your OnPrem instance and use it below. Note: Replace my-key-pair.pem with the name of the key-pair you created, this should be in your scratch pad. And replace 172.16.x.x with the Private IP associated with the ProdOnPrem instance. ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@172.16.x.x Then run the following commands to install SSM. Note: Replace \"activation-code\" and \"activation-id\" with the code and id on your scratch pad. sudo yum update -Y mkdir /tmp/ssm curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads-windows/SSMAgent/latest/linux_amd64/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm -o /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm sudo yum install -y /tmp/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.rpm sudo stop amazon-ssm-agent sudo amazon-ssm-agent -register -code activation-code -id activation-id -region us-east-1 sudo start amazon-ssm-agent exit Attention DON\u2019T Forget the last command above, this command start the ssm agent after activation - sudo start amazon-ssm-agent Task 3: Configure Systems Manager to enable management of on-premises systems In order to use Session Manager to connect to on-premises systems SSM needs to be configured for advanced-instances tier. To enable the advanced-instances tier: 1.Open the AWS Systems Manager console 2.In the navigation pane, choose managed instances . 3.Choose the Settings tab. 4.Choose Change account setting . 5.Review the information in the pop-up about changing account settings, and then, if you approve, choose the option to accept and click Change account setting . The system can take several minutes to complete the process of moving all instances from the standard-instances tier to the advanced-instances tier.\" 6.Select managed instances You should now see a new Advanced Instances label next to the managed instances Heading and you can now manage on-premises systems. Task 4: Create IAM users and policy restrictions based on tags The following steps require full access to IAM. 1.If you started this lab using Cloud9, continue to run the following commands from your Cloud9 session, use the create-user command to create the user. aws iam create-user --user-name MyWorkshopUser 2.Create your own and assign a password to the user by replacing the '######' symbols with that password. Please ensure you use a complex password. aws iam create-login-profile --user-name MyWorkshopUser --password ###### 3.Now we will create and attach an IAM Custom Policy to MyWorkshopUser. Create a new file with the following contents, save the file name: SSMDevAccess.json This file must reside in the same directory where your CLI session is running, or you must specify the location. { Version : 2012-10-17 , Statement : [ { Effect : Allow , Action : [ ssm:DescribeSessions , ssm:GetConnectionStatus , ssm:DescribeInstanceProperties , ec2:DescribeInstances , ssm:StartSession ] , Resource : * } , { Sid : ReadAlltheSSMThings , Effect : Allow , Action : [ ssm:Get* , ssm:Describe* , ssm:List* ] , Resource : * } , { Sid : SameUserTerminate , Effect : Allow , Action : ssm:TerminateSession , Resource : arn:aws:ssm:*:*:session/ ${ aws : username } -* } , { Sid : DenySMtoProd , Effect : Deny , Action : ssm:StartSession , Resource : [ arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/* ] , Condition : { StringLike : { ssm:resourceTag/Environment : Prod } } } ] } 4.Create the IAM policy using the file you just created aws iam create-policy --policy-name SSMDevAccess --policy-document file://SSMDevAccess.json The result should return the following: { Policy : { PolicyName : SSMDevAccess , PolicyId : ANPAJIFY55FF57L6ZEHKO , Arn : arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/SSMDevAccess , Path : / , DefaultVersionId : v1 , AttachmentCount : 0, PermissionsBoundaryUsageCount : 0, IsAttachable : true, CreateDate : 2019-03-21T20:51:21Z , UpdateDate : 2019-03-21T20:51:21Z } } 5.Copy the Account ID to your scratch pad, you will need it for the next instruction. You can find the AWS Account ID located in an IAM policy ARN, between \"iam\" and \"policy\", do not include the : symbols i.e. the AWS Account ID is 123456789012 given the following ARN \"Arn\": arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/SSMDevAccess . 6.To attach the policy, use the attach-user-policy command, replace the Account ID in the policy-arn below with the Account ID in your scratchpad. aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyWorkshopUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/SSMDevAccess 7.We also need to attach a policy that allows our workshop user to view the logs in CloudWatch. aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyWorkshopUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess 8.Let's attach a policy that allows our workshop user to view the events in CloudTrail. aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name MyWorkshopUser --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCloudTrailReadOnlyAccess 9.Verify that the policy is attached to the user by running the list-attached-user-policies command. aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name MyWorkshopUser The result should return the following: { AttachedPolicies : [ { PolicyName : CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchLogsReadOnlyAccess }, { PolicyName : AWSCloudTrailReadOnlyAccess , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCloudTrailReadOnlyAccess }, { PolicyName : SSMDevAccess , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/SSMDevAccess } ] } Task 5: Configure Logging Session Manager provides you with options for auditing and logging session activity in your AWS account. This allows you to do the following: Create and store session logs for archival purposes. Generate a report showing details of every connection made to your instances using Session Manager over the past 30 days. Generate notifications of session activity in your AWS account, such as Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notifications. Automatically initiate another action on an AWS resource as the result of session activity, such as running an AWS Lambda function, starting an AWS CodePipeline pipeline, or running an AWS Systems Manager Run Command document. We will log session data using Amazon CloudWatch Logs and generate access reports. To setup Session Manager logging in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, open the CloudWatch Console . In the navigation pane, choose Logs Choose Actions, Create log group. Type in the following name for the log group \"SSM-Logs\" Now open the AWS Systems Manager console . In the navigation pane, choose Session Manager Select Configure Preferences You have several configurations options, including: Specify Operating System user for session Enable KMS encryption for active sessions Write session output to an S3 bucket Send session output to CloudWatch Logs Select the check box next to CloudWatch Logs and uncheck Encrypt log data . Select Choose the log group name from the list specify the CloudWatch Logs group you created SSM-Logs and select Save . Additionally, you can view ssm-agent logs on the instance here: /var/log/amazon/ssm/amazon-ssm-agent.log /var/log/amazon/ssm/errors.log Task 6: Confirm appropriate access and review logs 1.Go to the IAM console , copy the IAM users sign-in link, it should look similar to this: https://123456789012.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 2.Open a new browser and paste in the IAM users sign-in link. Sign into the AWS account as MyWorkshopUser with the password you created earlier. Go to the AWS Systems Manager console . In the navigation pane, choose Session Manager 3.Make sure you are in the us-east-1 region (N.Virginia). Click Start session , select the ProdOnPrem name, click on start Session and a new session windows should open for you. This demonstrates that you can manage on-premises systems with Session Manager. 4.In the Session Manager session type the following: whoami The result should return the following: ssm-user 3.Click Terminate to end. 4.Repeat the steps above with DevEC2Instance, you must click Start session to see the systems. You should find the same results, the result should return the following: ssm-user 5.Click Terminate to end. 6.Now try ProdEC2Instance, click start Session. The result should return the following: 7.Go to the AWS Systems Manager , click on Session Manager , click on Session History . Your sessions should show up as Terminated or Terminating. Once the session has terminated you will see a link to CloudWatch Logs . Click on it to view the audit logs of your session, select Text on the right side of the menu. CloudWatch Logs will show details of the session such as commands that were run on the host. These logs can also be stored in S3 for you. 8.You can also view the Session Manager events in CloudTrail as well. Go to CloudTrail and find the Event name StartSession to view the details of your Session Manager session that CloudTrail captures. You Should see something like this: Troubleshooting \u2022 If your on-premises instances are showing offline, make sure the ssm-agent was re-started after the SSM activation process.","title":"Module 2: Session Manager"},{"location":"02-using-AWS-Systems-Manager-Session-Manager/#module-2-session-manager-30-minutes","text":"We were given the task to setup secure administrative access to our instances but we know that anytime someone logs into a system changes can be made and those changes could inadvertently affect the security of the host. Instead of hoping our system security doesn't change, let's ensure all changes introduced into production are treated like a code release which go through our standard deployment pipeline, this pipeline includes appropriate security and configuration checks as well as code reviews. Given this change to our process we will restrict all access into production systems. This approach to administrative access is called Immutable Infrastructure , which includes managing services and software deployments on IT resources wherein components are replaced rather than changed. An application or service is effectively redeployed each time changes are required. Given this is a new access pattern for our team, we will continue to allow access to our development systems. Using Amazon Systems Manager Session Manager and AWS IAM with tag based permissions we will implement this exact scenario and review the audit logs. In this Module we will create IAM roles with permissions to enable Session Manager access. Additionally, we are going to deploy 4 systems: AWS EC2 Instance tagged with development AWS EC2 Instance tagged with production Mock on-premises system tagged with development Mock on-premises system tagged with production Please note our mock on-premises systems will be EC2 instances, however we will treat them like on-premises systems by not assigning an Instance Profile. Terminology A managed instance is any machine configured for AWS Systems Manager. You can configure Amazon EC2 instances or on-premisess machines in a hybrid environment as a managed instance . Systems Manager supports various distributions of Linux, including Raspberry Pi devices, and Microsoft Windows Server. In the AWS Management Console, any machine prefixed with \"mi-\" is an on-premisess server or virtual machine (VM) managed instance . AWS Systems Manager offers a standard-instances tier and an advanced-instances tier for servers and VMs in your hybrid environment. Advanced instances also enable you to connect to your hybrid machines by using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. Session Manager provides interactive shell access to your instances. While this lab focuses on Session Manager which is a capability of AWS Systems Manager there are several other capabilities of AWS Systems Manager that you can take advantage of, more information about System Manager Capabilities","title":"Module 2: Session Manager ~ 30 minutes"},{"location":"02-using-AWS-Systems-Manager-Session-Manager/#tasks","text":"Create IAM roles and permissions to enable Session Manager Setup AWS Systems Manager to manage systems on-premises Create instances and install the SSM Agent Configure Systems Manager and enable management of on-premises systems Create IAM users and policy restrictions based on tags Configure logging Confirm appropriate access and review logs","title":"Tasks"},{"location":"02-using-AWS-Systems-Manager-Session-Manager/#task-1-create-iam-roles-and-permissions-to-enable-session-manager-for-amazon-ec2-instances","text":"1.Return to the AWS Cloud9 console and use the tab that you opened in Module 1. 2.Create an instance profile: aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name SSMLabProfile 3.Create the json trust policy doc to attach to the IAM role.

AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore, enables an instance to use AWS Systems Manager service core functionality. Depending on your operations plan, you might need permissions represented in one or more of the other three policies. To view this policy in the console go to services, IAM, Access Management, Policies and search for the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy, click on the policy, view the permissions by clicking on the permissions tab. Now attach this policy to the role using attach-role-policy command. aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name SSMServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore 10.Let's make sure we allow our on-premises systems to write to CloudWatchLogs so that we can use the same Audit and Logging tools to review administrative access. We'll use the same Attach-role-policy to attach a policy that enables the SSMServiceRole to write to CloudWatchLogs. aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name SSMServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy 11.Let's confirm all the correct policies are attached to our role. Run the following command. aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name SSMServiceRole The result should return the following: { AttachedPolicies : [ { PolicyName : CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy }, { PolicyName : AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore , PolicyArn : arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore } ] } 12.Let's also confirm the trust policy is correct. We want to confirm that for the Principal in the AssumeRolePolicyDocument is \"Service\":\"ssm.amazonaws.com\" , which allows the AWS Systems Manager Service the permissions granted in the policies we attached and listed in the previous steps.

If you lose the Code and ID, you must create a new activation. An activation expiration is a window of time when you can register on-premises machines with Systems Manager, default is 24 hours. An expired activation has no impact on your servers or virtual machines (VMs) that you registered with Systems Manager. This means that if an activation expires then you can\u2019t register more servers or VMs with Systems Manager by using that specific activation code. You simply need to create a new one.

We do not need a key pair for the AWS EC2 instances because we are using Session Manager to gain direct access. Attention If you are using Cloud9, please perform the following on the Cloud9 instance. 1.Create a key pair for SSH access to the on-premises systems. Choose a key name that you can remember, and replace MyKeyPair with that name. aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name MyKeyPair --query KeyMaterial --output text MyKeyPair.pem 2.Update the permissions on the private key file so that only you can read it. chmod 400 MyKeyPair.pem 3.Copy the name of your key pair to your scratch pad. Info What is a Key Pair? Amazon EC2 uses public key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public key cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, and then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair. Public key cryptography enables you to securely access your instances using a private key instead of a password. When you launch an instance, you specify the key pair. You can specify an existing key pair or a new key pair that you create at launch. At boot time, the public key content is placed on the instance in an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. To log in to your instance, you must specify the private key when you connect to the instance. 4.Go back to the CloudFormation Stack, copy the following to your scratchpad: Find the stack that starts with \"aws-cloud9-\" click on Resources , copy the ID next to the InstanceSecurityGroup Find the stack named \"InfrastructureIdentity-Env-Setup\", click on Resources , copy the ID next to PublicSubnet1 to the same scratch pad Tip At this point, make sure you have captured 3 items on your scratch pad: SECGROUP - the security group ID of the InstanceSecurityGroup SUBNET - the subnet ID of PublicSubnet1 MYKEYPAIR - the name of the key pair you created. 5.Let's use a script to build our systems.

Recently we announced a new feature that can be used for secure administration of EC2 Instances called Amazon EC2 Instance Connect. Amazon EC2 Instance Connect provides a simple and secure way to connect to your instances using Secure Shell (SSH). With EC2 Instance Connect, you use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and principals to control SSH access to your instances, removing the need to share and manage SSH keys. When you connect to an instance using EC2 Instance Connect, the Instance Connect API pushes a one-time-use SSH public key to the instance metadata where it remains for 60 seconds. The IAM policy attached to your IAM user authorizes your IAM user to push the public key to the instance metadata. The AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedKeysCommandUser, configured when Instance Connect is installed, tells the SSH daemon to look up the public key from the instance metadata for authentication, and connects you to the instance. You can use Instance Connect to connect to your instances using any SSH client of your choice or the Instance Connect CLI, or you can connect to your instances by using the new browser-based SSH client in the Amazon EC2 console.

Details like these are incredibly useful: A reproducible test case or series of steps The version of our code being used Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug Anything unusual about your environment or deployment","title":"Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests"},{"location":"contribute/#contributing-via-pull-requests","text":"Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that: You are working against the latest source on the master branch. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted. To send us a pull request, please: Fork the repository. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change. Ensure local tests pass. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation. GitHub provides additional document on forking a repository and creating a pull request .","title":"Contributing via Pull Requests"},{"location":"contribute/#finding-contributions-to-work-on","text":"Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on.
